A posix-compliant library to run external applications and capture the standard out and standard error.

## Why?

If you are developing cross platform command line apps, you need an easy way to run external applications. `Runner` provides just that.

## Usage

To execute a simple command you would do:

```swift
    let result = run("ls -a -l")
    print(result.stdout)
```
`result` type is `RunResults`, it contains:

- `exitStatus`: The command exit status
- `stdout`: The standard output for the command executed
- `stderr`: The standard error for the command executed

To customize the run function, you can pass in a customization block:

```swift
    let result = run("ls -all") { settings in
        settings.dryRun = true
        settings.echo = [.Stdout, .Stderr, .Command]
        settings.interactive = false
    }
```

`settings` is an instance of RunSettings, which contains the following variables:

- `settings.dryRun`: defaults to false. If false, the command is actually run. If true, the command is logged to the stdout paramter of result
- `settings.echo`: Customize the message printed to stdout, `echo` can contain any of the following:
    - `EchoSettings.Stdout`: The stdout returned from running the command will be printed to the terminal
    - `EchoSettings.Stderr`: The stderr returned from running the command will be printed to the terminal
    - `EchoSettings.Command`: The command executed will be printed to the terminal
